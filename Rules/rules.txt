 Rule No 1: Use Double Quote For String

           In Go Lang , String is represented as "viveshCodes" . 'viveshCodes' will throw an error if you use it as string.
 
Rule No 2 : How is variable declared at package level

            At package level we follow this style of declaring variable :
            (i)var num1 int =7781
            (ii) or use factored method
            (iii) We can't use := declaration here

Rule No 3 : Variable naming conventions for their scope
            (i) At package level : var number int = 7 
                This variable number (lowercase first letter) can be accessed anywhere in the same package .
            (ii) At package level : var Number int = 7 
                This variable number (uppercase first letter ) can be available globally , i.e, available to other packages also
            (iii) Block level : Variable declared at block level or function level can be available to particular function only

Rule No 4 : How to work with Acronym
            It's a good practice to declare variable ,which reflects Acronym , in Uppercase
            For example,
            var theHTTP string = "https://www.google.com"
            var theURL string ="https://www.google/com"

Rule No 5 : What do we have for printing and scanning 
            Print 
            Println
            Printf

            Scanln
            Scan            

 Rule No 6 : Every time we declare a variable in Golang , zero value is initialized to it.  

 Rule No 7 : We can't manipulate string, i.e,
            s:= "This Is String"
            we can't do s[2]="v"

Rule No 8 :  (i)We can't check equivalency of certain data types like Slice ,Map ,etc. 
             (ii) Slice can't be key to map.    But array can be a key type in map.
