Rule No 2 : How is variable declared at package level

            At package level we follow this style of declaring variable :
            (i)var num1 int =7781
            (ii) or use factored method
            (iii) We can't use := declaration here

Rule No 3 : Variable naming conventions for their scope
            (i) At package level : var number int = 7 
                This variable number (lowercase first letter) can be accessed anywhere in the same package .
            (ii) At package level : var Number int = 7 
                This variable number (uppercase first letter ) can be available globally , i.e, available to other packages also
            (iii) Block level : Variable declared at block level or function level can be available to particular function only

Rule No 4 : How to work with Acronym
            It's a good practice to declare variable ,which reflects Acronym , in Uppercase

            var theURL string ="https://www.google/com"
